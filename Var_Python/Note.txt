Var :
        Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location. 
        Python variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value.

Note:  Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits,
        but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.

Var Rules:
            1.The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).
            2.All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), 
            upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or 
            digit (0-9).
            3.Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or
            special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).
            4.Identifier names are case sensitive; for example, my name, 
                and MyName is not the same.
            5.Examples of valid identifiers: a123, _n, n_9, etc.
            6.Examples of invalid identifiers: 1a, n%4, n 9, etc.

Note: The equal (=) operator is used to assign value to a variable.
      Python does not create another object.
